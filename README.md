Improving Sleep Quality Through Data Analysis 💤📊

As a data science consultant for SleepInc, I analyzed anonymized sleep and lifestyle data from their SleepScope app to uncover patterns affecting sleep quality. 

Using Python, I explored relationships between exercise, gender, occupation, and other lifestyle factors to identify actionable insights that could help users optimize their sleep habits. 

This project highlights the power of data-driven strategies for health and wellness.

Analysis of SleepInc’s SleepScope app data for 374 individuals to explore factors influencing sleep quality, including exercise, stress, diet, and demographics, using Python for actionable insights.
